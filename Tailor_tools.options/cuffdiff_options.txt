##################### Library Normalization Methods

You can control how library sizes (i.e. sequencing depths) are normalized in Cufflinks and Cuffdiff. Cuffdiff has several methods that require multiple libraries in order to work. Library normalization methods supported by Cufflinks work on one library at a time.
Normalization Method 	    Supported by Cufflinks 	   Supported by Cuffdiff       Description
classic-fpkm  Yes 	    Yes       Library size factor is set to 1 - no scaling applied to FPKM values or fragment counts. (default for Cufflinks)
geometric     No 	    Yes       FPKMs and fragment counts are scaled via the median of the geometric means of fragment counts across all libraries, as described in Anders and Huber (Genome Biology, 2010). This policy identical to the one used by DESeq. (default for Cuffdiff)
quartile      No 	    Yes       FPKMs and fragment counts are scaled via the ratio of the 75 quartile fragment counts to the average 75 quartile value across all libraries.

#Cross-replicate dispersion estimation methods

Cuffdiff works by modeling the variance in fragment counts across replicates as a function of the mean fragment count across replicates. Strictly speaking, models a quantitity called dispersion - the variance present in a group of samples beyond what is expected from a simple Poisson model of RNA_Seq. You can control how Cuffdiff constructs its model of dispersion in locus fragment counts. Each condition that has replicates can receive its own model, or Cuffdiff can use a global model for all conditions. All of these policies are identical to those used by DESeq (Anders and Huber, Genome Biology, 2010)

################## Dispersion Method

Dispersion Method	Description
pooled 	   Each replicated condition is used to build a model, then these models are averaged to provide a single global model for all conditions in the experiment. (Default)
per-condition 	Each replicated condition receives its own model. Only available when all conditions have replicates.
blind 		All samples are treated as replicates of a single global “condition” and used to build one model.
poisson 	The Poisson model is used, where the variance in fragment count is predicted to equal the mean across replicates. Not recommended.

Which method you choose largely depends on whether you expect variability in each group of samples to be similar. For example, if you are comparing two groups, A and B, where A has low cross-replicate variability and B has high variability, it may be best to choose per-condition. However, if the conditions have similar levels of variability, you might stick with the default, which sometimes provides a more robust model, especially in cases where each group has few replicates. Finally, if you only have a single replicate in each condition, you must use blind, which treats all samples in the experiment as replicates of a single condition. This method works well when you expect the samples to have very few differentially expressed genes. If there are many differentially expressed genes, Cuffdiff will construct an overly conservative model and you may not get any significant calls. In this case, you will need more replicates in your experiment.
