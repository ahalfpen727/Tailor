cuffcompare v2.2.1 (4237)
-----------------------------
Usage:
cuffcompare [-r <reference_mrna.gtf>] [-R] [-T] [-V] [-s <seq_path>] 
    [-o <outprefix>] [-p <cprefix>] 
    {-i <input_gtf_list> | <input1.gtf> [<input2.gtf> .. <inputN.gtf>]}

 Cuffcompare provides classification, reference annotation mapping and various
 statistics for Cufflinks transfrags.
 Cuffcompare clusters and tracks transfrags across multiple samples, writing
 matching transcripts (intron chains) into <outprefix>.tracking, and a GTF
 file <outprefix>.combined.gtf containing a nonredundant set of transcripts 
 across all input files (with a single representative transfrag chosen
 for each clique of matching transfrags across samples).

Options:
-i provide a text file with a list of Cufflinks GTF files to process instead
   of expecting them as command line arguments (useful when a large number
   of GTF files should be processed)

-r a set of known mRNAs to use as a reference for assessing 
   the accuracy of mRNAs or gene models given in <input.gtf>

-R for -r option, consider only the reference transcripts that
   overlap any of the input transfrags (Sn correction)
-Q for -r option, consider only the input transcripts that
   overlap any of the reference transcripts (Sp correction);
   (Warning: this will discard all "novel" loci!)
-M discard (ignore) single-exon transfrags and reference transcripts
-N discard (ignore) single-exon reference transcripts

-s <seq_path> can be a multi-fasta file with all the genomic sequences or 
   a directory containing multiple single-fasta files (one file per contig);
   lower case bases will be used to classify input transcripts as repeats

-e max. distance (range) allowed from free ends of terminal exons of reference
   transcripts when assessing exon accuracy (100)
-d max. distance (range) for grouping transcript start sites (100)
-p the name prefix to use for consensus transcripts in the 
   <outprefix>.combined.gtf file (default: 'TCONS')
-C include the "contained" transcripts in the .combined.gtf file
-F do not discard intron-redundant transfrags if they share the 5' end
   (if they differ only at the 3' end))
-G generic GFF input file(s): do not assume Cufflinks GTF, do not
   discard any intron-redundant transfrags)
-T do not generate .tmap and .refmap files for each input file
-V verbose processing mode (showing all GFF parsing warnings)
